### This project demonstrates:
---
#### Version 1.0
- [x] Initiative.  
  * This project has gone through three distinctive versions.  The first version was the most basic, day-one introductory assignment from Iron Yard coding camp. All it required were: 
  
- [x] Build a homepage for your local ice cream shop. 
- [x] Initialize and push/pull to a GitHub repository.
- [x] Regular commits and use proper semantic HTML tags.
- [x] Include 
  * the shop's name
  * a brief history (use lorem ipsum)
  * a logo (any image you can find online)
  * the store's hours and contact information
  * flavors available (list at least 5 and no more than 42) with:
  * name, calorie count, and whether it is sugar free or not
  * a link to Wikipedia for that flavor
- [x] See every other flavor on the menu alternate its background color (commonly called "zebra striping")
- [x] Restrictions:
  * don't use any libraries, extension, modules, or frameworks other than normalize.css and font-awesome flexbox
  * don't use animations such as CSS3 or canvas.  You may use animated gifs, but keep them portfolio professional if you do.
  * don't use tables for layout of anything other than actual tabular data (depending on your design the ice cream flavors, whether they’re sugar free or not, and their calories may qualify as tabular data)
- [x] Use ```<aside>``` and CSS to create a left side-column with margins.
- [x] Create Mobile Responsive design
- [x] Create Social Media links

#### Version 2.0

But that wasn't enough for me.  I wanted to make it better.  Even though it was my first project, I wanted to show that I could improve on it, so I refactored the code to:

 - [x] create a JavaScript object 
 - [x] place that JavaScript object in a file that had to be imported to practice connecting html to JavaScript files.  
 - [x] create a JavaScript object that included with the name and the individual data for each type of ice cream.
 - [x] create a JavaScript function that imported the information, iterated through an object with multiple levels, sorted it alphabetically, and then use JavaScript to dynamically built a full table complete with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements which each contain the correct information and styling.
 
#### Version 3.0
